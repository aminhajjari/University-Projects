Super Resolution with Python - Danesh Academy

This repository contains the Python code demonstrated in the Danesh Academy YouTube video on Super Resolution. Super Resolution is a technique used to enhance the resolution of images, allowing for clearer and more detailed visuals by using machine learning algorithms.

ðŸš€ Overview
Super Resolution refers to the process of reconstructing a high-resolution image from a low-resolution input. This technique is widely used in various fields such as medical imaging, satellite image processing, and enhancing images captured in low-light conditions.

In this repository, we provide a simple implementation of a Super Resolution function that can be used to upscale images with improved clarity. This code can be used for educational purposes or as a starting point for more complex Super Resolution projects.

ðŸŒŸ Features
Upscale low-resolution images using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.
Easy-to-understand code, perfect for beginners and educational purposes.
Commented and well-structured for extension and modification.

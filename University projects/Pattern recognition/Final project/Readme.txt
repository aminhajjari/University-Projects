This project is related to the Statistical Pattern Recognition course, which is also a common topic in Machine Learning courses. The final project, associated with Yazd University and taught by Dr. Mohammad Taghi Sadeghi, is similar to an exercise assigned by Dorothea Blostein at Queen's University in Canada for the Winter semester of 2019. In this file, my code performs the required steps and implements the PCA and LDA algorithms, which are used to extract features and avoid the curse of dimensionality. It is worth mentioning that the steps have been programmed both using machine learning libraries and without using them.

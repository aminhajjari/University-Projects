"# University-Projects"




Welcome to the Yazd University Programming Projects repository. This collection features a variety of programming exercises completed during my studies. Each project includes a readme.txt file that provides detailed explanations specific to that exercise. While some exercises are inspired by assignments from other universities, every effort has been made to thoroughly comment on the code for clarity. The final versions presented here are optimized for efficiency and were developed within the projectâ€™s time constraints.

Of course, it will be more complete in the following semesters (by taking other courses).
